**Project Status: In Development**

`keyv` is currently under active development and may not be stable for production use.

`keyv` is a Rust port of the 'keyv' library from Node.js, offering a simple and unified interface for key-value storage across various backends like Redis, MongoDB, and SQLite. It leverages Rust's strong typing for safety and performance.

### How to Install
To include `keyv` in your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
keyv = "version"
